[======= Strings =======]
> On String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer
         If your string is not going to change use a String class because a String object is immutable.
         If your string can change (example: lots of logic and operations in the construction of the string)
            and will only be accessed from a single thread, using a StringBuilder is good enough.
         If your string can change, and will be accessed from multiple threads, use a StringBuffer because
            StringBuffer is synchronous so you have thread-safety.

> Formatting Strings
        Several options: String.format, System.out.printf, Formatter.format
        All format specifiers start with %. For example %d displays a decimal value, but you can also use
            many others like %.2f. This formats a float to 2.
            significant figures.
            Parts of Format Specifiers
                %[arguement index][flags][width][precision]conversion
                conversion types: d (integers), f (floats), s (strings)
                           flags: 0 (adds 0s, ex %04d - meaning the width is 4 and any empty space if filled
                                        in with up to 4 0s.)
                                  - (left justifies text, default is right)
                                  , (separator, for example int x = 1000000, %,d is 1,000,000)
                                    (space, adds an empty space at the begining, good for signed values, % d
                                                                                                          234
                                                                                                         -234)
                           width: Integer (the width of the data to display W:%3d, ex  W: 52
                                                                                       W:123)
                 arguement index: Most common is no arguement index. You can specify which format specifier goes
                                        with an input. Ex ("%$3d %$2d %$1d", 100, 200, 300) => "300 200 100"
        Use the Formatter class to format streams of data. See JavaWorkshop.stringFormatterWriter()

[======= Collections =======]
> Common Collection Interfaces
        Collection: Basic collection operations. Collection also extends Iterable. This means it has an iterator, or
                    cursor, that allows us to progress/move through the collection. If you are looping through data
                    then use for, if you are modifying data while you are iterating through it use an iterator.
              List: Collection that maintains a particular iteration order
       Queue/Deque: Collection with the concept of order and specific head element. Deque can be used like a stack.
               Set: Collection that contains no duplicate values
         SortedSet: A Set whoe members are sorted
> Common Collection Classes
         ArrayList: A List backed by a resizable array
                    Efficient random access but inefficient random inserts
        LinkedList: A List and Queue backed by a doubly-linked list
                    An ordered set of data elements, each containing a link to its successor
                    Efficient random insert but inefficient random access
           HashSet: A Set imiplemented as a hash table
                    Efficient general purpose usage of any size
           TreeSet: A SortedSet implemented as a balanced binary tree
                    Members accessible in order but less efficient to modify and search than Hashset
> Sorting
        Two ways to specify behavior
            (1)Comparable Interface: See JavaWorkshop.collectionSort_comparable()
                            Implmented by the type to be sorted
                            Type specifies own sort behavior (should be consistent with equals)
            (2)Comparator Interface See JavaWorkshop.collectionSort_comparator()
                            Implmented by type to perform sort
                            Specifies sort behavior for another type, returns -1 (o1 < o2), 0 (equal), 1 (o1 > o2)
> Maps
        Common Map Interfaces
                  Map: Basic map operations
                        Methods
                            put, add key and value
                            putIfAbsent, add key and vali if key not contained or value null
                            get, return value for key, if key not fround return null
                            getOrDefault, return value for key, if key not found return provided default value
                            values, return a collection of the contained values
                            keySet, return a Set of the contained keys
                            forEach, perform action on each entry
                            replaceAll, replace all values
            SortedMap: Map whose keys are sorted
                        Methods
                            firstKey, return first key
                            lastkey, return last key
                            headMap, (<) return a map for all keys that are less than the specified key
                            tailMap, (>=) return a map for all keys that are greater than or equal to the specified key
                            subMap, return a map for all keys that are greater than or equal to the starting key and
                                        less than the ending key
        Map Classes
                  HashMap: Efficient general purpose Map implementation
                           + Makes absolutely no guarantees about the iteration order. It can (and will) even change
                           completely when new elements are added.
                  TreeMap: SortedMap implemented as a self-balancing tree
                           Supports Comparable and Comparator sorting
                           + Will iterate according to the "natural ordering" of the keys according to their compareTo()
                           method (or an externally supplied Comparator). Additionally, it implements the SortedMap
                           interface, which contains methods that depend on this sort order.
            LinkedHashMap: iterate in the order in which entries were put into the map.
                HashTable: Generic name for hash-based maps. Obsolete since Java 1.1.
> Types
                 Lists: Iteration order
                  Sets: Uniqueness
         Queues/Deques: Modification order
                  Maps: Collection of pairs

[======= Multithreading =======]
> Thread Pools: Create queues for us to put task into, a lot easier than dealing with threads directly where it is easy
        to misuse. Assigns tasks to a pool of threads. Handles details of managing threads.
> Synchronized: The synchronized keyword prevents concurrent access to a block of code or object by multiple Threads.
        By default, a Hashtable is synchronized, so only one thread can access the table at a time.

[======= Annotations =======]
> Give classes and methods context and intent in the form of meta data.
          @Override: when compiler sees this annotation it checks to see if the method directly below it is overriding
                    a method, otherwise it will display a compliler message.
        @Deprecated: if an implmentation is using a method that is marked as @Deprecated, the compiler will display
                    a message indicating so. This is useful if a new definition is written and we want to let users
                    know that the old method is deprecated.

[======= Serialization =======]
> Provides method for object persistence.
> Two-parts: Serialize and Deserialize, esstially converting an object to a stream of bytes and vis-a-versa.
        Implement Interface Serializable, but remember it has no methods, meaning it's a marker interface. Also,
            remember that primitives are serializable, but other types are not unless they implement the marker
            interface Serializable. The Class String is an example of a reference type that implements serializable.
> Use ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream
> Keyword transient - If you define any data member as transient, it will not be serialized.

[======= Generics =======]
> Type <?> is shorthand for <? extends Object>, which in turn is a wildcard saying that we do not know they type, but
        we know that it extends object. Why not use <Object>? Using object you lose type safety, while using ? allows
        you to "lock in" on the type even thought we don't know it at runtime.


[======= Misc. =======]
> Try-with-resources: The try-with-resources statement is a try statement that declares one or more resources. A
        resource is an object that must be closed after the program is finished with it. Great for streams.
